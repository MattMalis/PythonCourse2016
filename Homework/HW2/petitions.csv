Petition Title,Date Published,Number of Signatures,DescriptionFormally Recognize The Ku Klux Klan As A Terrorist Organization,10-Jul-16,115617,"Ever since the inception of the Ku Klux Klan in December 24,1865 they have terrorized American citizens. This group has a long history of murder & intimidation of people based on color and religion. The KKK has lynched 3446 blacks and 1297 whites based of the research of The Tuskeegee Institute. The KKK has raped,murdered people for registering to vote, and destroyed towns built by African Americans. Clear documented evidence is available through picture and video of their murderous acts. Black Americans have suffered the most under this terror group. Terrorism is the use of violence and intimidation in pursuit of political aims. We ask if ISIS or ISIL is labeled a terrorist group for their acts, then surely the KKK fit the clear description of a terrorist."Rescind the decision to deploy THAAD antimissile system in South Korea.,15-Jul-16,106755,"The U.S. and South Korean governments, against wide opposition of South Koreans (and strong subsequent backlash from local citizens of the deployment site), have agreed to deploy U.S.-made THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Air Defense) system in South Korea. This measure is supposedly to counter North Korean ballistic missiles and provide additional security, yet this is a controversial move that will likely to escalate tension in the region, by provoking North Korea, China and Russia into a spiraling arms race in the region that is already heavily militarized with weapons of mass destruction. Now, more than ever, is the time to step back and de-escalate tensions by pursuing negotiated settlements that will provide sustainable peace mechanism in the Korean Peninsula and the surrounding region.""August 15th is NOT Independence Day For Sikhs. SUPPORT the Liberation of Indian Occupied Punjab to Create ""KHALISTAN"".",10-Jul-16,104025,"1947 did not bring independence for Sikhs in India where followers of Sikhism, the world's 5th largest religion are labeled as ""Hindus""; Sikh Golden Temple was destroyed by Indian Army; Sikhs were subjected to genocide in Nov 84 and thousands were extra-judicially killed  by security forces for demanding right to self determination.
Sikhs demand the Independence of Punjab, their historical homeland, BECAUSE Sikhs:
- Have a separate religion;
- Are the indigenous people of Punjab; and
- Have been subjected to genocide in India;
THUS, Sikhs have the right to self-determination under Article 1 of:
- International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ; and
- International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.
WE URGE America to Support the Independence of Indian Occupied PUNJAB"No Respite for Highly-skilled Americans-in-Waiting. Need Portable Work Authorization & Recapture 500K Green Cards,11-Jul-16,102560,"On Nov 25th 2014, President Obama signed an executive action (https://goo.gl/wPP4K9) that would make it possible for the highly-skilled workers to obtain portable work authorization (I140 EAD and AP). Close to two years since then, there have been no updates on this action. Thousands of green cards are being wasted every year, with an estimated 500,000 green cards wasted so far, while the highly-skilled workers continue to wait in a queue that may take 20-50 years. We urge you to review and take necessary actions to recapture unused green cards, and provide portable work authorization. We want what American workers want ‰ÛÒ No H-1B worker increases and an equal opportunity to help us build our careers, innovate, and contribute towards the American economy."I would like our government to stop providing a safe haven to Fethullah Gulen  and I want him delivered to Turkey,17-Jul-16,100980,"On July 15, 2016 there was a coup attempt to overthrow the legitimately and democratically elected government of Turkey. Since than it has become clear that perpetrators were a small group of soldiers loyal to Fethullah Gulen and his FETO terrorist organization. Turkey has been and is our most dependable and long time ally in the Middle East. Gulen has been classified a terrorist by our allies in Turkey. The coup attempt in Turkey has been stopped with the courageous outpouring of our friends the Turkish people. Please help me to convince our president and our government that we as the United States should work with democratically elected authorities &amp; governments. I would like our government to stop providing a safe haven to Fethullah Gulen and I want him delivered to turkey.""CHARGE Donald J. Trump, 18 U.S. Code å¤ 2381 - TREASON",27-Jul-16,30238,Donald Trump has incited Russia to hack into and publish Hillary Clinton's private emails. The Republican presidential candidate is openly ENCOURAGING a foreign government to take illegal actions that would influence a US election. This is the first time that a major presidential candidate has actively encouraged a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent. This has gone from being a matter of politics to being a national security issue."Human Rights Violation by Hong Kong Government, request US Government impose int'l sanctions on HK and CHINA Government",2-Aug-16,20239,"HK Electoral Affairs Commission disqualified localists, Chan Ho-tin of Hong Kong National Party, Edward Leung of Hong Kong Indigenous, Alice Lai of Conservative Party and District Councilor James Chan from running in Legislative Council election this Sep for their political views."Stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline which endangers the water supply to Native American reservations.,15-Aug-16,12723,"The Dakota Access pipeline is set to be constructed near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, crossing under the Missouri River which is the only source of water to the reservation. The pipeline is planned to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day. The potential of oil leaks would contaminate the only source of water for the reservation. While Dakota Access claims oil leaks are unlikely, an oil leak from a separate pipeline in North Dakota was discovered (8/15/16) to have leaked over 500 barrels of oil since the leak began on July 19, 2016. You can read the article here: http://bit.ly/2aVm5cv. A leak like this from the Dakota Access pipeline would leave the Standing Rock Sioux without any clean water."STOP federal fumigation of 3.5 American citizens in Puerto Rico with pesticide Naled as effort to combat Zika virus.,21-Jul-16,11514,"A legitimate health concern regarding Zika virus exists for many US jurisdictions including Puerto Rico. However, PR has been particularly singled out by the federal government. The CDC, EPA & some local PR govnt authorities, in an effort to ‰Û÷control the spread of the virus‰Ûª, have plans to spray the pesticide Naled over large swaths of PR‰Ûªs population. There is an absolute lack of transparency and credibility from decision makers. Over 80% of the people oppose harmful Naled fumigation. We demand transparency.  We ask the President's intervention to stop this action against citizens of our nation. The rights of life, liberty &  pursuit of happiness are not mere words, but rather a protection against unwanted govnt actions.  These rights are as essential as the air we breathe. STOP NALED."Disavow support for the Clinton political dynasty. Disqualify and remove Hillary Clinton from 2016 Presidential Ballot,2-Aug-16,10895,We call for disqualification and removal of Hillary Clinton from the presidential ballot as dynastic succession of the Clinton family in American politics breaches the core democratic principles laid out by our Founding Fathers.Free Artem Vaulin,21-Jul-16,6920,"the founder of kat.cr was arrested in Poland. It is another attack on freedom of rights of internet users globally. We think it's our duty not to stand aside but to fight back supporting our rights. In the world of regular terrorist attacks where global corporations are flooded with money while millions are dying of diseases and hunger, do you really think that torrents deserve so much attention? Do you really think this fight worth the money and resources spent on it? Do you really think it's the real issue to care of right now? We don‰Ûªt! "Remove Gunsmithing from ITAR.,6-Aug-16,6869,"The Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) has redefined Gunsmithing in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List (USML). Gunsmithing in nearly every case is not in the business of Exporting defense articles. This new ""direction"" will devastate most mom and pop small gunsmith businesses by the heavy and costly burden of having to register with the DDTC the same as a Defense Arms Exporter supplier just because they need to drill a hole or if they make a discontinued part for a gun made in the 1800's just ONE time. This will cause many small gunsmith businesses to go out of business. This new rule must be changed with gunsmithing removed and left to the ATF rules only."Grant Immediate Asylum to Gulen Followers in the U.S. or entering the U.S. Fleeing Turkey,24-Jul-16,5243,"Turkish President Erdogan has long been wrongfully accusing Gulen Movement of treason and terrorism. The newest dictator of the world, staged a fake coup and blamed it on the defenseless citizens following Gulen&#039;s teachings. Over 100,000 lost jobs, property and dignity. Some fleed early and came to the U.S. some may still be able to flee, though Erdogan cancelled passports of all Gulen followers. We urge the Congress to act swiftly to grant immediate asylum to Gulen followers in or entering U.S. Over 10,000 currently jailed by Erdogan regime and are under heavy torture without any rights to due process. This is terribly in line with the rise of the Third Reich and we must do everything in our power to help save human dignity."CMS NEEDS TO ENSURE TRANSPARENCY IN ITS ROBUST BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LARGE PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS (PBMS),26-Jul-16,4965,"Three large PBMs manage prescription drug benefits for more than 180 million Americans.  PBMs have clients on two sides - pharmacy clients and health plans/payors (Medicare, DoD TRICARE and FEHBP). They also own their own mail order and/or retail pharmacies and that puts them in direct competition with their small pharmacy clients. This leverage incentivizes them not to reimburse their small pharmacy clients in a fair and timely manner - this is not just and Congress needs to support CMS in their efforts to scrutinize these unfair practices.""Honor fallen Border Patrol Agent Javier ""Harvey"" Vega Jr. for his sacrifice with a Line of Duty Death (LODD) designation",1-Aug-16,4088,"On August 3, 2014, BPA Vega was enjoying an evening of fishing with his family in Willacy County, Texas, approximately 35 miles north of the U.S. / Mexico Border in South Texas. Two criminal illegal aliens approached the family and attempted to rob them, subsequently opening fire on them. BPA Vega was shot and killed during the commission of this criminal act, while attempting to protect his family from these two criminal aliens, who had both been previously deported several times. During the shootout, BPA Vega's father was also shot and is still recovering to this day. BPA Vega lost his life doing what he had been doing all of his life, which was protecting others. CBP's Commissioner has refused to classify his death as a LODD in direct violation of the CBP Valor Memorial Directive."Request The Commission On Presidential Debates To Allow Gary Johnson And Jill Stein Into The Presidential Debates,27-Jul-16,3367,"We, the undersigned, demand that the Federal Government voice our concern to The Commission on Presidential Debates - that the Presidential debates should include all Presidential candidates who have qualified for enough state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning the election."Have EA make Skate 4,12-Aug-16,2496,We the people are in need of a new installment to the skate franchise. Its been over 6 years since the last installment was released. And we are in desperate need of a new skateboarding video game.Pick our Presidents with Paper,29-Jul-16,2465,"2 out of the 3 major electronic voting machine companies are Clinton foundation donors.  This is a clear conflict of interest, and considering that this is already going to be a multi-billion dollar election, it is of the utmost importance to squash any doubt from the American people about the legitimacy of their elections. Paper ballots are much harder to alter and rigging would be much more visible.  The added cost of paper ballots pales in comparison to the multi-billion dollar campaigns being run and the preservation of our sacred voting process.""Petition to nominate Paisley Park, residence and studio of Prince Rogers Nelson as a National Historic Landmark",1-Aug-16,2460,"To President Barack Obama and the National Historic Landmark Program

It is against our democracy to elect a new president when the voice of the people has not been heard.  Every vote that was cast, needs to be counted!
How can this country continue if there are exit poll discrepancies of far beyond 2%?"
